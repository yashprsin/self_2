"""
Guido Van Rossum created the Python Programming language in February 1991. Python is an interpreted, high-level,
general-purpose programming language.

Python allows us to create a game, build web apps, do general-purpose scripting, etc.



Before we dive into the details of Python, let's understand what the term Programming or Coding means?

Programming helps human beings to reduce hours of manual effort.

In today's era, demand for programming is growing rapidly; i.e., there is a huge need for software developers and
programmers in IT (Tech) Industries.

To write code in any language, we need a friendly platform where we can write the code and can execute it. For this,
we use IDEs.

IDE – An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides many comprehensive facilities
to programmers for software or application development.

Python is used by many of the best tech companies. A few of those companies are:

Instagram
Facebook
Google
Reddit
Spotify
Quora
Dropbox
Netflix

Data Types in Python:
Primarily there are the following data types in Python.

Integers (<class 'int'>): Used to store integers
Floating point numbers (<class 'float'>): Used to store decimal or floating-point numbers
Strings (<class 'str'>): Used to store strings
Booleans (<class 'bool'>): Used to store True/False type values
None: None is literal to describe 'Nothing' in Python
Rules for defining a variable in Python:

A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores (_). For E.g. : demo_xyz = ‘It’s a string variable’
A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
It can't start with a digit. For example, 5harry is illegal and not allowed.
No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
Also, reserved keywords are not recommended to be used as variable names.
Examples of few valid variable names are harry, _demo, de_mo, etc.


Comments, Escape Sequences & Print Statement
Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute.
Comments can be written to mark the author's name, date when the program is written, adding notes for
your future self, etc.

Comments are used to make the code more understandable for the programmer.
The Interpreter does not execute comments.


There are two types of comments in Python Language -:

Single Line Comment
Multi-Line Comment
"""

# I am a Single.
"""

# Data Type
x = 1<2

"""

String1 = 'hello my nam is shivani.'
String2 = "Merry and Tom loved each other."
String3 = '''Yash is not a boy.'''
"""

"""
x = String1.capitalize()
print(x)
"""

"""
String = "Your name is "
user_input = input("Enter your name : ")
print(String, end=user_input.capitalize())
"""
String = "Tom is a handsome boy.He is doing his work."
x1 = 1,2,3,12,2,312,3,1,1,1,
"""
string.count(): This function counts the total no. of occurrences of any character in the string. 
It takes the character whose occurrence you want to find as an argument.
"""
x = String.endswith("work.")
print(x)
