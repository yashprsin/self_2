A Process is an instance of a program, e.g. a Python interpreter. They are independent from each other and do not share the same memory.

Key facts:

- A new process is started independently from the first process
- Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
- Separate memory space
- Memory is not shared between processes
- One GIL (Global interpreter lock) for each process, i.e. avoids GIL limitation

Great for CPU-bound processing
Child processes are interruptable/killable
Starting a process is slower that starting a thread
Larger memory footprint
IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
