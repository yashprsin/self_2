A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution (Also known as "leightweight process").
A Process can spawn multiple threads. The main difference is that all threads within a process share the same memory.

Key facts:

Multiple threads can be spawned within one process
Memory is shared between all threads
Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
Great for I/O-bound tasks
Leightweight - low memory footprint
One GIL for all threads, i.e. threads are limited by GIL
Multithreading has no effect for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL
Not interruptible/killable -> be careful with memory leaks
increased potential for race conditions
